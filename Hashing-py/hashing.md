# 🧠 Hashing Practice Plan – Data Structures

This plan is for practicing **Hashing in Data Structures**, focusing on implementation and problem-solving. The goal is to understand how hash tables work internally and how to use them effectively in algorithmic problems.

---

## ✅ Overview

- **Focus:** Hash tables, hash functions, collision handling
- **Time Required:** ~1–2 hours
- **Language:** Recommended: Python, Java, or C++

---

## ⏱️ Schedule

### 1. 🔍 Theory Refresher (10–15 minutes)

Review the following concepts:

- ✅ What is a hash function?
- ✅ What is a hash table / hash map?
- ✅ What is a collision?  
- ✅ Collision Resolution Techniques:
  - Chaining (Linked Lists)
  - Open Addressing (Linear & Quadratic Probing)

### 2. 🔧 Build a Simple Hash Table (30–45 minutes)

Implement your own hash map without using built-in dictionaries or maps.

#### 📘 Tasks:
- [ ] Define a hash function
- [ ] Implement insert (`put(key, value)`)
- [ ] Implement search (`get(key)`)
- [ ] Implement delete (`remove(key)`)
- [ ] Use **chaining** for collision handling

📌 (Optional) Try **open addressing** after chaining.

### 3. 🧩 Coding Practice on LeetCode (30–45 minutes)

Solve these problems using hash maps:

#### ⭐ Beginner
- [ ] [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [ ] [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)
- [ ] [First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

#### ⚡ Intermediate
- [ ] [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)
- [ ] [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)
- [ ] [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

---

## 🧪 Stretch Goals (Optional)

- [ ] Implement open addressing (linear or quadratic probing)
- [ ] Explore built-in hash maps in another language (Java `HashMap`, C++ `unordered_map`)
- [ ] Implement a better hash function
