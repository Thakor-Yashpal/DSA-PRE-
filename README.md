# üìò DSA-PRE- (Python DSA Practice Suite)

A hands-on collection of Python scripts and problems for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** preparation, with a view toward real-world usage (e.g. algorithmic trading, automation).  

---

## üìÇ Project Structure & Topics

This repo is organized into modules & scripts covering a wide variety of DSA & algorithmic themes. You can pick and choose topics to practice or extend.

### Directories / Scripts

- **1D-Array/**  
  Problems and solutions based on one-dimensional arrays: traversals, subarrays, prefix sums, two pointers, sliding window, etc.

- **ALL_Factors-nu/**  
  Number theory problems: finding factors, prime factorization, divisibility, etc.

- **Extracyion_of_Digits/**  
  Digit manipulation and extraction: sum of digits, reverse digits, digit frequency, palindrome check, etc.

- **Frequency-dict.py**  
  Counting / frequency problems using dictionaries or maps: mode, frequency count, anagrams, etc.

- **Hashing-py**  
  Hashing / hash table / map-based problems: collision handling, hash sets, frequency maps, etc.

- **time-space.py**  
  Scripts and commentary about analyzing **time complexity** and **space complexity** of algorithms; sample problems annotated with complexity.

- **geranl.py**  
  General utility scripts, helper functions, or miscellaneous practice problems.
