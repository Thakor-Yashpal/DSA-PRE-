# ðŸ“˜ DSA-PRE- (Python DSA Practice Suite)

A hands-on collection of Python scripts and problems for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** preparation, with a view toward real-world usage (e.g. algorithmic trading, automation).  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure & Topics

The repository contains multiple Python scripts and folders covering different DSA topics:

- **1D-Array/** â†’ Problems and solutions related to arrays.
- **ALL_Factors-nu/** â†’ Programs to calculate factors of numbers.
- **Extracyion_of_Digits/** â†’ Scripts to extract digits and perform digit-based operations.
- **Frequency-dict.py** â†’ Program to count frequency of elements using dictionaries.
- **Hashing-py** â†’ Hashing-related problems and practice.
- **time-space.py** â†’ Scripts for analyzing time and space complexity.
- **geranl.py** â†’ General utility or practice problems.
